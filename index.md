## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs
* Lab 3:
    This was one of my favorite labs because I was able to meet someone who truly helped me and let me understand the work that I was doing. During this lab I was taught how to declare variables and other small things that I didn’t know I could do. We also were able to communicate very well and had a great partnership.

* Lab 4:
    This was one of my favorite labs because my partner from the week prior and I got paired again, with an additional member to challenge our perspectives. We had a very good group dynamic and were challenging each other’s thoughts and ideas. We ultimately came out with a good lab in the end.

* Lab 12:
    This last lab was one of my favorites because I was able to really dive in on my own and help out my team. We were all able to contribute and change roles every few minutes. My partners also knew a lot of material so I was able to learn from them as we went.
